# Pillar 3 Implementation Summary

## Synthesis Quality and Safety (Medical Domain)

This document summarizes the implementation of Pillar 3 workstreams for the MedSearch AI project.

## Implemented Workstreams

### 1. Grounded, Citation-First Synthesis ‚úÖ

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced synthesis prompt to require citations for every factual claim
- Added explicit instruction: "CRITICAL: Use citation numbers [1], [2], etc. for EVERY factual claim"
- Citation extraction from all agent results (research, clinical, drug)
- Inline citation anchors [1], [2], etc. link to source metadata

**Key Features**:
- No claim surfaces without at least one citation
- Citations include: title, authors, journal, publication date, DOI, PMID, NCT ID
- Relevance and confidence scores for each citation
- Source type identification (PubMed, Clinical Trial, FDA Drug)

**Code**:
- `backend/app/agents/synthesis_agent.py`: `extract_citations()`, enhanced `_build_synthesis_prompt()`
- `backend/app/models/schemas.py`: `Citation` model with all required fields

### 2. Conflict Detection & Consensus Panel ‚úÖ

**Implementation**:
- Async conflict detection using Vertex AI Gemini Flash
- Analyzes top-k results for contradictory conclusions
- Generates consensus summary when conflicts detected
- Surfaces conflicts in synthesis prompt for balanced presentation

**Key Features**:
- Detects contradictory evidence across studies
- Generates "Consensus vs Contradictions" summary
- Instructs synthesis to address both perspectives
- Explains possible reasons for discrepancies

**Code**:
- `backend/app/agents/synthesis_agent.py`: `detect_conflicts()` function
- `backend/app/agents/state.py`: Added `conflicts_detected` and `consensus_summary` fields
- `backend/app/agents/workflow.py`: Passes conflict data through workflow

**Example Output**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Contradictory Evidence Detected:
Some studies show Treatment X is effective [1,2], while others show no benefit [3,4].
Possible reasons: different patient populations, dosage variations, study design.
```

### 3. Confidence Band (Low/Medium/High) ‚úÖ

**Implementation**:
- Multi-factor confidence calculation:
  - Evidence count (30% weight)
  - Relevance scores (50% weight)
  - Recency (20% weight)
- Three-tier band: Low (<0.4), Medium (0.4-0.7), High (‚â•0.7)
- Displayed alongside confidence score

**Key Features**:
- `calculate_confidence_score()`: Base confidence from result quality and quantity
- `calculate_recency_score()`: Scores based on publication dates (1.0 for current year, decreasing 0.1/year)
- `get_confidence_band()`: Weighted combination of factors
- Transparent confidence assessment

**Code**:
- `backend/app/agents/synthesis_agent.py`: Confidence calculation functions
- `backend/app/agents/state.py`: Added `confidence_band` field

**Confidence Bands**:
- **High**: ‚â•7 high-quality recent results with strong agreement
- **Medium**: 4-6 results or mixed quality/recency
- **Low**: <4 results or low relevance/old data

### 4. Filters Propagate to Synthesis ‚úÖ

**Implementation**:
- Filters flow through entire pipeline: API ‚Üí Workflow ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Synthesis
- Filter information included in synthesis prompt
- Synthesis acknowledges applied filters in response

**Supported Filters**:
- **Year Range**: `{"start": 2020, "end": 2024}`
- **Study Types**: `["RCT", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", "Cohort", "Case-Control", "Case Report"]`
- **Sources**: `["pubmed", "clinical_trials", "fda_drugs"]`

**Validation**:
- Year range validation (start < end, no future dates)
- Study type validation (only allowed types)
- Filter validation before search execution

**Code**:
- `backend/app/core/safety.py`: `validate_filters()` function
- `backend/app/agents/synthesis_agent.py`: Filter information in prompt
- `backend/app/api/search.py`: Filter validation in API endpoint

**Example Prompt Addition**:
```
üîç Applied Filters:
  - Year range: 2020 to current
  - Study types: RCT, Meta-Analysis
  
NOTE: All results below have been filtered according to these criteria.
```

### 5. Safety Guardrails ‚úÖ

**Implementation**:
- **Medical Disclaimer**: Automatically appended to all responses
- **Rate Limiting**: 20 requests/minute per IP
- **Unsafe Content Detection**: Blocks self-harm, illegal drug manufacturing, prescription fraud
- **PII Redaction**: Removes email, phone, SSN, credit cards from logs
- **Audit Logging**: PII-free logging with hashed user IDs
- **Crisis Resources**: Automatic crisis hotline info for sensitive queries

**Key Features**:

#### Medical Disclaimer
```

```

#### Unsafe Content Patterns
- Self-harm: "kill myself", "suicide", "self harm"
- Drug manufacturing: "make meth", "synthesize cocaine"
- Prescription fraud: "fake prescription", "forge rx"

#### PII Redaction

#### Crisis Resources
For sensitive queries, automatic inclusion of:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: 741741
- International resources
- Emergency services: 911

**Code**:
- `backend/app/core/safety.py`: Complete safety module
- `backend/app/api/search.py`: Integration in API endpoints
- Rate limiting via `slowapi` library

Response:
"First-line treatment for type 2 diabetes typically includes metformin [1,2], 
which has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels by 1-2% [1]. Recent studies also 
support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular benefits [3,4]..."

Citations:
[1] Smith et al., "Metformin efficacy in T2D", NEJM, 2023
[2] Jones et al., "First-line diabetes treatment", Diabetes Care, 2023
[3] Brown et al., "SGLT2 inhibitors and CV outcomes", Lancet, 2024
...

Confidence: 0.87 (High)
‚öïÔ∏è Medical Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only...
```

### Example 2: Conflicting Evidence
```
Query: "Is vitamin D supplementation effective for COVID-19?"

‚ö†Ô∏è Contradictory Evidence Detected:
Some studies show vitamin D reduces COVID-19 severity [1,2], while others 
show no significant benefit [3,4]. Differences may be due to baseline vitamin D 
levels, dosage, and timing of supplementation.

Response addresses both perspectives...

Confidence: 0.62 (Medium)
```

### Example 3: Filtered Search
```
Query: "RCT studies on metformin from 2020-2024"

Filters Applied:
- Year range: 2020 to 2024
- Study types: RCT

Response acknowledges filters and cites only RCTs from specified period...
```

### Example 4: Sensitive Query (Blocked)
```
Query: "how to kill myself"

Response: 400 Bad Request
"Query blocked: Query contains potentially harmful content.

üÜò If you're in crisis:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
..."
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Advanced Conflict Resolution**: Use meta-analysis techniques to weight conflicting studies
2. **Study Quality Scoring**: Incorporate journal impact factor, citation count
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Track how consensus changes over time
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate response quality
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different disclaimer placements and wording
6. **Multilingual Safety**: Extend unsafe content detection to other languages

## Conclusion

4. ‚úÖ Filters propagate to synthesis
5. ‚úÖ Safety guardrails (disclaimer, rate limiting, PII protection)

The implementation follows medical AI best practices, ensures user safety, and provides transparent, well-cited responses suitable for a medical research assistant.
