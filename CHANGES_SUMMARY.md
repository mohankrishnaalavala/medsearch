- LRU eviction policy (512MB limit)
- Fallback mechanism

### 5. Resilient Architecture
- Graceful degradation
- Mock data fallback
- Automatic recovery
- Health checks with retries

### 6. Production Deployment

- HTTPS/WSS with Let's Encrypt
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Monitoring stack (ES + Kibana + APM)

## Verification Against Current Setup

### Development (docker-compose.yml)
- âœ… Elasticsearch 8.15.1 with security disabled
- âœ… Redis 7-alpine with LRU eviction
- âœ… APM Server 8.15.1 with Elasticsearch output
- âœ… Kibana 8.15.1 for visualization
- âœ… API with all environment variables
- âœ… Frontend with Next.js
- âœ… Nginx reverse proxy
- âœ… Certbot for SSL

### Production (internal_docs/docker-compose.prod.yml)
- âœ… Elasticsearch with security enabled
- âœ… Redis with same configuration
- âœ… API with production settings
- âœ… Frontend with relative URLs
- âœ… Nginx with SSL volumes
- âœ… Proper resource limits

### Environment Variables (backend/.env.example)
- âœ… Vertex AI models configuration
- âœ… Reranking settings
- âœ… Elasticsearch configuration
- âœ… Search fusion settings
- âœ… Redis configuration
- âœ… APM configuration
- âœ… Performance settings

## Demo Script Highlights

### Key Messages
1. **Problem**: 15-20 hours â†’ 20 seconds (99.97% reduction)
